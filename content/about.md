+++

**Double Open aims to provide enterprises with a complete, open and automated workflow for open source compliance.** We believe that an open ecosystem for open source component analysis should be built together. That's why engaging the ecosystem in an inclusive way is at the heart of what we do. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we focus on filling the gaps between existing tools and standards, and providing a solution based on a common big picture.

**Launched as a research project in 2018**, Double Open was tasked with finding out how to make open source compliance more open. We approached the question by leveraging existing tools and standards, looking at what was out there, identifying gaps, and then building a proof of concept. The project was run by **HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law**, together with collaborators in the ecosystem, including Validos ry, a Finnish association that has been providing open source compliance services to its members since 2008. 

The project's research-stage PoCs demonstrated full compliance workflows based on open tools and data, but they were not yet ready for scale. To enable that step, **Double Open  was spun off into a business of its own in 2023**. Providing solutions for automated software composition analysis (SCA) and open source compliance, Double Open Oy now builds on the opportunities revealed by the research. HH Partners remains a close partner of Double Open.
