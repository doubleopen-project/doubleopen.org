Double Open is a research project aiming to find out how to make open source compliance more open. We approach this by leveraging existing tools and standards and looking at what is out there, identifying gaps and then making a proof of concept. Ideally, the proof of concept would demonstrate a full workflow for open source compliance based on open tooling and open data.

We do not aim to create completely new tools or standards. What we are looking for is a better understanding of what a full, open and automated workflow for enterprise needs looks like. We will survey the global ecosystem for existing tools and initiatives, and aim to identify a common big picture among many participants in the ecosystem.

A large part of the Double Open project is to communicate with the ecosystem and be inclusive: the open ecosystem for open source compliance should be built together by many.

Double Open project has started in December 2018 and will continue preliminarily until June 2020.

Double Open is a research project, and as such, does not sell anything or seek profit: as a part of the project we will research eventual business models for different actors in an open ecosystem for open compliance. However, implementing business models is not a part of the Double Open -project.

Double Open is run by HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law, together with collaborators in the ecosystem. The initial collaboration partner is Validos ry, a Finnish association offering open source compliance services to its members, since 2008. HH Partners is a Helsinki based law firm that has worked regularly in open source compliance since 2006, in large as assigned by Validos ry, but also in other connections.
