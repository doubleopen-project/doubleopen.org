+++

Double Open is a research project aiming to find out how to make open source compliance more open. We approach this by leveraging existing tools and standards and looking at what is out there, identifying gaps and then making a proof of concept. Ideally, the proof of concept would demonstrate a full workflow for open source compliance based on open tooling and open data.

We do not aim to create completely new tools or standards. What we are looking for is a better understanding of what a full, open and automated workflow for enterprise needs looks like. We will survey the global ecosystem for existing tools and initiatives, and aim to identify a common big picture among many participants in the ecosystem.
