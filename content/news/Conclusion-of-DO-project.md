### **Some great achievements from Double Open**

* Creation of a new [meta-layer for Yocto](https://github.com/doubleopen-project/meta-doubleopen) for the creation of SPDX-files. The creation of SPDX-files is now being developed in Open Embedded and available to all Yocto users in future versions of Yocto.  
* Fossology implemented API functionality based on Double Open needs.  
* Double Open is using [OSS Review Toolkit (ORT)](https://github.com/doubleopen-project/ort) evaluator and reporter at the end of the pipeline.  
* Acting as an interoperable bridge between different open source projects for creating an end-to-end automated compliance pipeline.  

### **Achieving project objectives**

As a research project, the Double Open project set itself and achieved the following research objectives:
1. getting image-specific package and file information (SBOM) out of Yocto to SPDX-format is in place,  
2. relevant package, license and copyright data in SPDX format are stored,  
3. automatically determine license compliance of a Yocto project with the Policy Engine using license data from Fossology,  
4. an end-to-end repeatable process, which produces a supporting artefact and/or alerts for further actions,  
5. automatically build a notice file for a Yocto project using copyright data from Fossology,  
6. enable CVE monitoring based on the SBOM.  

Double Open also aimed to find a way to synchronise the licensing data between two separate Fossology instances. The project did not achieve this goal, but we still consider this an important issue and will continue to explore this in the future.  

Therefore, the project has been deemed completed and a great success by the steering group. We have moved to next stage, market pilot, where the Double Open approach is refined for continued production for multiple projects. At the same time, we are testing the viability to continue Double Open as a business.  

As the project manager, I would like to thank all our collaborators and our own work staff for the project thus far. This is the end to the project phase but a mere introduction to the whole story that is Double Open. Please see our upcoming posts regarding the results of the Double Open and a few links to our published code. Also see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/doubleopen-project), which is updated with a faster interval than this main website.
