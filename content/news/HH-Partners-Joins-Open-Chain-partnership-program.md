SAN FRANCISCO, October 10, 2019 – [HH Partners](https://www.hhpartners.fi/en/), a lawfirm based in Finland, today announces participation in the [OpenChain Project](https://www.openchainproject.org/). HH Partners intends to support adoption of the OpenChain industry standard for open source compliance both inside Finland and across the broader global market. HH Partners will be contributing to the OpenChain project both via its open technology practice and via its own open source compliance research project, Double Open. 

The [OpenChain Project](https://www.openchainproject.org/) establishes trust in the open source from which software solutions are built. It accomplishes this by making open source license compliance simpler and more consistent. The [OpenChain Specification](https://www.openchainproject.org/get-started) defines inflection points in business workflows where a compliance process, policy or training should exist to minimize the potential for errors and maximize the efficiency of bringing solutions to market. The companies involved in the OpenChain community number in the hundreds. The OpenChain Specification is being prepared for submission to ISO and evolution from a growing de facto standard into a formal standard.

“Open source compliance in the supply chain is a challenge to all companies. The [OpenChain Project](https://www.openchainproject.org/) has already achieved and demonstrated a simpler way for organizations to learn and progress in open source compliance. Standardization is a way of unifying expectations, and therefore it simplifies processes. We are excited to leverage our network in Finland to further our joint goals with OpenChain and help organizations achieve better open source compliance” says [Martin von Willebrand](https://www.hhpartners.fi/en/staff/martin-von-willebrand-2/), Partner and Head of [Open Technology](https://www.hhpartners.fi/en/our-expertise/open-technologies/) at HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law Ltd. 

“The key to a successful community is to build great relationships,” says Shane Coughlan, OpenChain General Manager. “Establishing a formal relationship with HH Partners underlines our pre-existing and fruitful collaboration over many years. Martin and his team have long been a lynchpin of open source legal knowledge in North Europe, and their engagement today is a reflection of how the project and its associated industry standard is gaining momentum.”

### **About OpenChain**  
The [OpenChain Project](https://www.openchainproject.org/) builds trust in open source by making open source license compliance simpler and more consistent. The [OpenChain Specification](https://www.openchainproject.org/get-started) defines a core set of requirements every quality compliance program must satisfy. The [OpenChain Curriculum](https://www.openchainproject.org/resources) provides the educational foundation for open source processes and solutions, whilst meeting a key requirement of the OpenChain Specification. [OpenChain Conformance](https://www.openchainproject.org/get-started/conformance) allows organizations to display their adherence to these requirements. The result is that open source license compliance becomes more predictable, understandable and efficient for participants of the software supply chain.
