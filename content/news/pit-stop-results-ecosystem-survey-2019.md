The Double Open Short Ecosystem Survey 2019 is currently in progress. We have already received quite a few answers, but welcome more to get a better sample of the current landscape. You can access the pit stop results (version 2) of Double Open Short Ecosystem Survey 2019 [here](https://github.com/doubleopen-project/doubleopen-publications/blob/master/Ecosystem%20survey%202019/Pit%20stop%20results%20v2%2020190314.pdf).

We can already see the leaders in different areas, but more results are needed to clarify the picture. For that, the survey is still open (takes maximum 5 mins, based on several testers):

With this survey, we investigate the existing landscape and the popularity of existing tooling. The final and pit stop results will be published anonymously as part of our [publications](https://github.com/doubleopen-project/doubleopen-publications/tree/master/Ecosystem%20survey%202019) under the CC-BY-4.0 license.
