Double Openâ€™s market pilot was concluded in early 2023 with the following key findings:

- The proposed approach solves real client problems and helps significantly in open source software
compliance. Pilot customers issued positive references.
- There is a demand for continued use and expansion of the solution.
- The current approach is not technically scalable, so a scalable offering is needed to serve a
  larger customer base.

Based on the market pilot, the Double Open project decided to invest in the development of a scalable
software product. The plan is to repilot key parts of the offering with existing pilot customers
with a technically scalable product later during 2023.
