Double Openâ€™s market pilot was concluded in early 2023 with the following key findings

- The proposed approach solves real client problems and helps significantly in open source software
compliance. Pilot customers issued positive references.
- There is demand for continued use and expansion of the solution.
- The current approach is not technically scalable and a scalable offering is needed for further
  customers.

Based on the market pilot, the Double Open project decided to invest into development of a scalable
software product. The plan is to repilot key parts of the offering with existing pilot customers
with a technically scalable product later during 2023.
