Weâ€™re proud to announce the establishment of Double Open Oy and the Double Open project
being spun off from HH Partners into Double Open Oy. The goal for the first year of operation is to develop a
scalable software product and deploy it with a growing number of pilot customers. The development
will continue in open on [GitHub](https://github.com/doubleopen-project).

We have secured the initial funding and the necessary resources for the target and will continue to
build the team.

The Double Open project has been a research project at HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law, since its
launch in 2018. The research revealed a broad need for a component analysis solution and identified 
several underserved technologies. The research also indicated that these needs could be met by 
a commercial service. A market pilot conducted by HH Partners in 2022-2023 showed that while a practical 
solution could be implemented, it would require a scalable product. HH Partners started developing a scalable
solution in the summer of 2023, resulting in the spin-off into Double Open Oy during the same autumn.
