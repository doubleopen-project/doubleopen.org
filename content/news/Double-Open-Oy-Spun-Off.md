Weâ€™re proud to announce the establishment of Double Open Oy and spinning off the Double Open project
from HH Partners to Double Open Oy. The target for the first year of operation is to build a
scalable software product and pilot it with a growing number of pilot customers. The development
will continue in Github, publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/doubleopen-project).

We have secured the initial funding and the necessary resources for the target and will continue to
build the team.

The Double Open project has been a research project at HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law, Ltd since its
start in 2018. The research showed wide need for a component analysis solution, and showed several
under-served technologies. Further it showed that a commercial service could theoretically fulfil
these needs. A market pilot carried by HH Partners in 2022-2023 showed that a practical solution can
be implemented. However,  a scalable product is needed. HH Partners started developing a scalable
solution in the summer of 2023 which resulted in spin-off to Double Open Oy during autumn 2023.
