We're proud to announce that our co-founder Sebastian Schuberth has been nominated as full-time CEO
of Double Open Oy, starting as of today, 1 November 2023.

Double Open has lived as a research project within HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law, for some years and
has now been spun off into its own company by Sebastian and the other co-founders Martin von
Willebrand, Mikko Murto, Toni Päärni and Marko Jaanu. Led by Sebastian, we are excited to take the next step
on our journey.
