We're proud to announce that our Co-Founder Sebastian Schuberth has been nominated as full-time CEO
of Double Open Oy, starting today 1 November 2023.

Double Open has lived as a research project within HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law for some years, and
has now been spun off to its own company with Sebastian and other Co-Founders Martin von
Willebrand, Mikko Murto, Toni Päärni and Marko Jaanu. Together we are excited to start the next step
of our journey, led by Sebastian.
