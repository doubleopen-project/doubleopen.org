Double Open is open source compliance as a service. We have both the technical and the legal expertise to provide technical support for the implementation and use of the OSS Review Toolkit (ORT) and legal support for the creation and maintenance of policies and rules.

During the Double Open market pilot, we are helping end-users to automate open source compliance with ORT and provide technical and legal services as well as support in the use of ORT. Besides ORT-supported package managers, we are able to support Yocto embedded Linux build systems in the same process. Fully automated systems for license compliance have not yet been developed, but we strive to automate most of the manual work required for this.

Our development philosophy is openness. You can follow the development of the product we use on our GitHub page [here](https://github.com/doubleopen-project). The tools we use are open source tools, on top of which we develop our own code, also as open source available on our GitHub page, to integrate the different processes or stages of the process so that the end-user has an end-to-end tool for open source license compliance.

The Double Open tool and service are built at HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law, whose lawyers specialize in open source issues. The development of Double Open has also involved consultation with the industry and the open source ecosystem.

If you or your office are interested in learning more about the Double Open service, please get in touch by emailing toni.paarni@hhpartners.fi. We are also likely to conduct a market survey later to further examine the licensing compliance needs of companies of all sizes, so stay tuned.
