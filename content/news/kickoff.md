Open source has eaten the world, but organizations are still struggling with effective open source compliance. Tools and data are stuck in-house or behind proprietary licenses. Double Open is a research project aiming to find out how to make open source compliance more open. We approach this by leveraging existing tools and standards and looking at what is out there, identifying gaps and then making a proof of concept. Ideally, the proof of concept would demonstrate a full workflow for open source compliance based on open tooling and open data.

“Open source compliance needs open tools to support it. There are already many great and open tools, but unfortunately these do not support a full workflow for enterprise needs. The trend towards DevOps has increased the speed of development, further emphasizing the need for automation in the field”, explains **Marko Jaanu**, Member of the Board at Validos ry. ”Commercial tools offer some solutions, but truly open solutions would be needed for the whole ecosystem to participate and benefit out of open source compliance. For example anyone can offer open source compliance related services on top of open toolings.” Marko Jaanu has been nominated to the board of Validos ry by one of its founding members, Fujitsu Finland Oy, where Marko serves as the open source point-of-contact.

“The Double Open project does not aim to create a new open solution or new standards. There are many existing tools already. However, what’s needed is a better understanding of what a full, open and automated workflow for enterprise needs would look like. We will survey the global ecosystem for existing tools and initiatives, and aim to identify a common big picture among many participants in the ecosystem”, says **Martin von Willebrand**, the project owner and Partner at HH Partners, Attorneys-at-law, Ltd. “At best we would be able to help others and ourselves to build and fill the missing gaps together.”

The first publication of the Double Open project is accessible at doubleopen.org. It covers an initial survey of open source initiatives, compliance tools and development technologies/tools. The publication is licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

If you are engaged with open source compliance, please help us in creating a more comprehensive survey later and assessing the popularity of relevant tools and technologies by completing our short ecosystem survey. The short ecosystem survey can be accessed [here](https://google.com/forms) for at least for a week from this date. Filling out the survey should not take more than 5 minutes for open source compliance personnel at organizations.

The short ecosystem survey results will be published as a second publication at doubleopen.org during March 2019. The project will run until June 2020. The project plans to issue further publications as the research project progresses. You can also subscribe for updates at [doubleopen.org](https://www.doubleopen.org) – you will receive no more than one update per month.
